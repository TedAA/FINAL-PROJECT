What state do i want my project to be in 4 hours from now?
What state do i want my project to be in 1 week?

Tonight: 
Understanding of how to open communications between my 30-pin (iphone) to serial port to beagle board. (currently missing a DB9 Female to Female connector.) Currently understand that something must be installed to have communications go over the iPhone to serial connection.  Node?


In one week:
Detailed sketch of components and processes and what i would need to write to make them work.

e.g.

1) sensor will connect to beagleboard via wires to a sensor port(?) -- should receive sensor tomorrow.

2) usb to serial will connect double female serial (need double female to connect 30 pin/serial with serial/usb) will connect to 30pin will connect to iPhone.

3) motion will trigger motion sensor and set off event on beagle board
4) script needs to listen for motion trigger
5) Fire off event which will fire camera on iPhone
